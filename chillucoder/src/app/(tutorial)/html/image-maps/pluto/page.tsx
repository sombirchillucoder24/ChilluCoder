        "The western lobe 'Sputnik Planitia' is a 3-4 km deep impact basin filled with nitrogen ice.",
        "Convection cells in the nitrogen ice create polygonal patterns 10-40 km across, constantly renewing the surface.",

        "At farthest distance (aphelion), most of the atmosphere freezes out onto the surface.",
        "Pluto's axial tilt of 122Â° means it essentially rolls along its orbital path like Uranus.",
